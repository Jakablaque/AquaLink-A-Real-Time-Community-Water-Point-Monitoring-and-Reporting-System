Project Proposal: AquaLink – Clean Water Access Monitoring & Reporting System
Problem Statement
Access to clean and safe drinking water remains a persistent challenge in many rural and underserved communities, especially across developing regions. Despite significant investment in water infrastructure, issues such as broken boreholes, vandalized water pumps, dry wells, and contamination often go unreported or unresolved for extended periods due to lack of a centralized, accessible reporting mechanism. This leads to prolonged water shortages, increased risk of waterborne diseases, and a lack of trust in local service providers.

Current reporting methods—such as word of mouth, community meetings, or manual paper trails—are inefficient, slow, and often inaccessible to marginalized groups. Additionally, the absence of real-time monitoring tools limits the ability of government agencies and NGOs to make informed, timely interventions.
Objectives
1. Enable real-time reporting of broken, unsafe, or inaccessible water sources using a mobile-friendly digital platform.
2. Visualize and track reported issues via an interactive, geolocation-based map dashboard.
3. Facilitate timely response and resolution of reported water infrastructure issues by relevant authorities.
4. Empower communities with a simple, multilingual, and inclusive interface for water source reporting—even in offline conditions.
5. Provide administrators with actionable data and trends through an analytics dashboard to inform policy and improve service delivery.
Target Communities
- Rural and peri-urban communities that rely on public or communal water sources such as boreholes, wells, and pumps.
- Water utility administrators and NGOs working in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sectors.
- Local government units responsible for public infrastructure and service delivery.
- Health and development organizations focused on improving quality of life through access to clean water.
Projected Impact
- Reduced downtime of public water sources through faster reporting and repair cycles.
- Improved public health outcomes by minimizing exposure to contaminated or inaccessible water.
- Increased community participation and ownership of water infrastructure maintenance.
- Greater transparency and accountability in the delivery of water services.
- Stronger data-driven decision-making by stakeholders through access to real-time reports and trend analytics.
Proposed Solution
AquaLink is a full-stack, user-centric platform designed to bridge the communication and action gap between communities and water service providers. It features:

- A mobile-first web application where users can easily report faulty or unsafe water sources with photos, location data, and voice notes.
- An offline-capable reporting module that stores reports and syncs them when the device reconnects to the internet.
- A robust admin dashboard for local authorities and NGOs to view reports on an interactive map, change statuses, and track performance metrics.
- A Django REST Framework backend to manage data securely and efficiently, and a Next.js frontend to deliver responsive, real-time interfaces.
- Role-based access control, multi-language support, and optional notification systems to ensure accessibility, security, and user engagement.

This solution ensures that every voice counts, every drop is accounted for, and no community is left behind in the journey toward universal access to clean water.
